# Not Taking App!

The intent of this project is to create an express backend to serve up html files to the client as well as make basic CRUD updates to the data via the RESTful API. The note taking application will save note data to a flat db (json) and make it available to the user to see notes. There is an exposed API to directly pull the note data from the application.
